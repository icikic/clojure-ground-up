;; Exercise 1
;; --------------------------------------------------------------------------

;; One would naturally expect counties with more people to have more crime!
;; Divide the :driving_under_influence of each county by its :county_population to find a prevalence of DUIs,
;; and take the top ten counties based on prevalence. How should you handle counties with a population of zero?

;; Expand most-duis to return vectors of [county-name, prevalence, report-count, population]
;; What are the populations of the high-prevalence counties?
;; Why do you suppose the data looks this way? If you were leading a public-health campaign to reduce drunk driving,
;; would you target your intervention based on report count or prevalence? Why?
